                    Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix on November 27th, 1942 at Seattle King County Hospital. He was later
                    renamed by his father as James "Al" Hendrix. Hendrix showed an interest in guitars at very young
                    age.
                    As a child, his father would find him play guitar using a broom and decided to buy Hendrix a one string ukelele to
                    practice. His earliest inspirations included B.B King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Holly, and
                    Robert Johnson.

                    Early Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1958, Hendrix's father, Al, bought him his first acoustic guitar. Soon after,
                    Hendrix joined his first
                    band, The Velvetones. His time with the band did not last due to Hendrix wanting to pursue his own
                    interest several months later.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the summer of 1959, Al purchased Hendrix's his first electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S. This
                    was
                    the same guitar he used when joining The Rocking Kings.

                    In 1961, Hendrix enlisted in the US army and he was stationed in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. In 1962, he
                    earned
                    the right to wear the "Screaming Eagles" patch for the paratroop division. While in the army, he
                    formed a band called The King Casuals with bassist Billy Cox. Later he was discharged due to an
                    injury he received during a parachute jump.

                    <br>
                    Towards the end of 1965, Hendrix played with several acts including the Isley Brothers, Ike and Tina
                    Turner, Sam Cooke and Little Richard. Afterward, Hendrix formed another band called Jimmy James and
                    the
                    Blue Fames playing the lead guitar of the group.

                    Hendrix got his big break when Animals' bassist Chas Chandler saw Hendrix play a performance at Caf,
                    Wha?
                    in 1966. Chandler would later return to sign Hendrix and have him move to London
                    and form a new band. Chandler would have Jimmy, as he was previously known, become "Jimi" and a new band was formed known as the
                    Jimi Hendrix Experience including Mitch Mitchell as drummer and Noel Redding as bassist.

                    <br>
                    The Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single became a huge hit, "Hey Joe", which stayed in the UK
                    charts reaching the top 6 in 1967. Shortly after, they came out with their full-length album, Are You
                    Experienced? This album is known as one of the most popular rock albums of all time including major
                    hits like "Purple Haze, "Foxey Lady", "The Wind Cried Mary", "Fire" and "Are You Experienced?".

                    <br>
                    When Hendrix returned to the US, his performance of "Wild Thing" ignited the crowd at the Monterey
                    International Pop Festival in June 1967. It was this performance that made The Jimi Hendrix
                    Experience become one of the most popular and highest grossing touring acts in the world.
